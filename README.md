## Foundations of Data Science with R

**Course Description:** This foundational course offers a full-spectrum introduction to data science and data science workflows, emphasizing data as a source of value creation in an organization. The R programming environment serves as the implementation vehicle in support of essential data science activities---data exploration and visualization, data wrangling, predictive modeling, model deployment, and communication. The R programming environment, along with Python, is among the most important tools in the data scientist's toolbox. This course will feature tools and a style of programming inspired by the popular tidyverse ecosystem---ggplot2 for data visualization, dplyr and tidyr for data wrangling. Students will master elements of the data science workflow through a series of short R programming exercises reinforced by a full-spectrum, integrative final project. Presentation skills are an ever-present theme as students are challenged, through every stage of analysis, to communicate managerial relevance and value to an organization.
